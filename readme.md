# LibAssist

LibAssist, your personal Library Assistant, is a tool to keep documentation for various libraries organized. Right now, it is an app that can open `ladoc` files and show the documentation encoded in them. For more information on how to author `ladoc` files, check out [Libassist Format](https://github.com/Supermegadex/libassist-format).
