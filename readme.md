# LibAssist

LibAssist, your personal Library Assistant, is a tool to keep documentation for various libraries organized.
Right now, it is an app that can open `ladoc` files and show the documentation encoded in them.
For more information on how to author `ladoc` files, check out [Libassist Format](https://github.com/Supermegadex/libassist-format).

**Contributions welcome!**

I would love help with whatever you'd like to help with!
I especially need assistance with security, accessibility, 
and the electron backend. Please fork and submit a PR if
you'd like to contribute!
